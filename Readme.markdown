## Corona Sample Code

These samples have been adapted for cross-platform deployment in the following ways:

* Automatic content scaling for multiple screen dimensions using an optional "config.lua" file with either "letterbox" or "zoomEven" scale mode.

* Android device permissions added to "build.settings" where appropriate; for example, Android requires specific permissions for GPS, Internet access, or using the camera.

For more information on the "config.lua" and "build.settings" files, see the following guides:

* [Project Configuration](https://docs.coronalabs.com/guide/basics/configSettings/index.html) 
* [Project Build Settings](https://docs.coronalabs.com/guide/distribution/buildSettings/index.html)
